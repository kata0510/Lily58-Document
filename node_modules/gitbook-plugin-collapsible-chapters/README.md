#Collapsable chapters for GitBook
==============

This is a fork of `gitbook-plugin-expandable-chapters`. This provides smaller, less in-the-face icons

---

This plugin adds an icon to each chapter, that has a child and css states for the child list to collapse/expand ones.

### How to use it?

Add it to your `book.json` configuration:

```
{
    plugins: ["collapsible-chapters"]
}
```

Install your plugins using:

```
$ gitbook install
```

### Configuration

There is no configuration needed at the moment, can be left empty.

```
{
	"pluginsConfig": {
		"collapsible-chapters":{}
	}
}
```
